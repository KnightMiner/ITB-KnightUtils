# KnightUtils
This repository contains a collection of utilities for making Into the Breach mods. For information on how to use the utilities, see the function headers or the cooresponding page on the [wiki](https://github.com/KnightMiner/ITB-KnightUtils/wiki).

In general, for all utilities you can use them by copying the file to a folder in your mod under `scripts/libs`, then import using `require`
